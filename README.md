## Work-Day-Scheduler-Challenge
# Description #
For this weeks challenge i was asked to create a work day scheduler, that alows the user to type in a note and save it to the page.
 It also requires moment.js functionality to colour block upcoming events for the day.

# Acceptance Criteria #

* I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
* When I open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
* When I scroll down I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
* When I view the timeblocks for that day each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
* When I click into a timeblock I can enter an event
* When I click the save button for that timeblock the text for that event is saved in local storage
* when I refresh the page the saved events persist
